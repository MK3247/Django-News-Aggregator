# Django News Aggregator


## Motivation 

This project was motivated by the need to create a web application that consolidates the latest news updates across the globe into one place. Today, news updates are released almost every minute. However, this information is scattered all over the world. As a result, it is overwhelming and time-consuming to visit different news sites to get all these updates. This web application aims at reducing this hustle by gathering the latest news updates from leading news websites across the world into one place.
